# Kaggle Competition

In this competition I was challenged to predict the package delivery time by small transportation vans. This was an individual competition between 50 students from the Master in Business Analytics and Big Data at IE University with the duration of 4 hours. The evaluation metric for this competition was the MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and we were allowed to use Dataiku, R or Python. I used Python, did some feature engineering and my final XGBoost model finished in 3rd place.
